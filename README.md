# Deep-Learning

These are Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Materials given by deeplearning.ai and Andrew NG.

##Learning Objectives

- Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
- Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
- Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
- Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
- Describe hidden units and hidden layers
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Implement forward and backward propagation
- Apply random initialization to your neural network
- Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
